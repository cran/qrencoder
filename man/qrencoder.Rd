\title{Quick Response Code (QR Code) / Matrix Barcode Creator}
\description{
Quick Response codes (QR codes) are a type of matrix bar code and can be
used to authenticate transactions, provide access to multi-factor authentication
services and enable general data transfer in an image. QR codes use four standardized
encoding modes (numeric, alphanumeric, byte/binary, and kanji) to efficiently store
data. Matrix barcode generation is performed efficiently in C via the included
'libqrencoder' library created by Kentaro Fukuchi.
